# HFO Gen87.X3 Handoff — 2026-01-03 (IR-0014)

## 🚨 INCIDENT IR-0014: COPILOT_RATE_LIMIT_INTERRUPTION
**Status**: CRITICAL / ACTIVE
**Pattern**: Frequent interruptions and "Try Again" prompts during high-intensity tool use (especially `run_in_terminal` and `read_file` sequences).
**Mitigation for Next Agent**:
1. **Batch Tool Calls**: Avoid long sequences of individual tool calls.
2. **Context Optimization**: Keep the context window lean.
3. **Blackboard Coordination**: Use `obsidianblackboard.jsonl` as the primary source of truth for state transitions.
4. **Async Heartbeats**: If the session hangs, check the blackboard for the last successful emission.

## 📍 Current Location
- **Workspace**: `c:\Dev\active\hfo_gen87_x3`
- **HIVE Phase**: `H` (Hunt) / `I` (Interlock)
- **Last Action**: Verified `hot/silver` showcases via Playwright. Vite server running on port 8081.

---

## 📊 Technical State
- **Unit Tests (Vitest)**: 1242/1242 PASSING.
- **E2E Tests (Playwright)**: 11/102 FAILING.
- **Showcase Verification**: 
    - Port 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 demos verified functional.
    - Screenshots stored in `.playwright-mcp/` (e.g., `port-0-observer.png`, `port-1-bridger.png`).
- **Key Blockers**:
    - Port 5173 vs 8081 mismatch in legacy specs.
    - "Pipeline Theater": Events emitted but not injected into DOM.
    - GoldenLayout race conditions in BDD tests.
- **Red Queen (Port 4)**: Mutation testing infrastructure is operational. `one-euro.ts` hardened to 89.66%. `gesture-fsm.ts` is at 71.86% (needs hardening).

## 🎯 Next Steps for Incoming Agent
1. **Harden `gesture-fsm.ts`**: Kill the remaining 33 mutants to reach the 80% threshold.
2. **Fix E2E Port Mismatch**: Search and replace `localhost:5173` with `localhost:8081` in all `.spec.ts` files.
3. **Bridge the "Theater" Gap**: Ensure `showcase-launcher.ts` correctly calls `DOMAdapter.inject()` so E2E tests can interact with the pipeline.
4. **Stabilize GoldenLayout**: Address the race conditions in `showcase-goldenlayout.html`.

## 📡 Blackboard Coordination
Always check `obsidianblackboard.jsonl` before starting.
Emit a `COLD START` signal upon arrival.
