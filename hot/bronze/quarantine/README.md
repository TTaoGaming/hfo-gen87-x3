# 🔒 Bronze Adapter Quarantine Zone

## Date Quarantined: 2026-01-01

## Status: FAILED TYPE CHECK

These files were quarantined by machine gates (pre-commit hook typecheck).
They contain **17 TypeScript errors** and cannot be committed until fixed.

## Files in Quarantine

| File | Errors | Issue Type |
|------|--------|------------|
| `deliver-goldenlayout.ts` | 12 | GoldenLayout 2.x API incompatible, unused vars |
| `fuse-wrapper.ts` | 2 | exactOptionalPropertyTypes, unused import |
| `sense-mediapipe.ts` | 2 | undefined not assignable to required param |
| `shape-passthrough.ts` | 1 | unused import |
| `index.ts` | 0 | Orphaned - depends on quarantined files |
| `nats.integration.test.ts` | 0 | Test file - depends on quarantined files |

## Why Quarantined

These adapters were generated by AI and contain multiple issues:

1. **GoldenLayout API mismatch** - The adapter was written for GL 1.x but GL 2.x has incompatible constructor signature
2. **TypeScript strictness violations** - `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` catches subtle type bugs
3. **Unused code** - Dead imports and unused variables indicate rushed/incomplete code
4. **Missing null checks** - Methods called on possibly-null objects

## Recovery Path

To rehabilitate these files:

1. Fix all TypeScript errors locally
2. Run `npm run typecheck` - must pass
3. Add unit tests that exercise the fixed code
4. Move back to `hot/bronze/src/adapters/`
5. Pre-commit hooks will re-validate

## Lesson Learned

**AI-generated code requires machine verification before acceptance.**

The gates worked: pre-commit blocked commit of broken code.
