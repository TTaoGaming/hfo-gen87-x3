the daedalos with emulators would be perfect for what I want to do. I want to do excalidraw but it can then w3c pointer into emulators directly. give me some more search and ideas. you can see my vision for total tool virtualization, what would be the steps to do this, this is my primitive i am building for so much more than this
---
I think you are losing context create The Obsidian blackboard following my actual HFO format and then just append the note and get ready for hand off right now we're in the first hand phase Now we're just looking for information and finding exemplars and I'm seeing so many new options that I didn't know it was impossible so this is great the original tech stack that I was thinking was closer toward like media to repair physics to finite state machine to W3C pointer to whatever I want 
---
ok now use the tools. check my pipeline trade study and do another check. how can we set up hexagonal CDD? I want to set up the components and then let ai swarm combine and evolve and use the primitives does that make sense? we need to research this. the hive/8 workflow was never designed to be sequential that's only bootstrap it should be powers of 8 :1010 at minimum
---
daelos and other window apps like emulator js could solve classes of problems
---
check my pipeline trade study and use sequential thinking and tavily and other tools to create a new v2 with more info especially with my goal of hexagonal CDD exemplar composable pieces, I can create many different for map elite. I don't need to be vendor locked
---
need to note a few things. we need to visualize the state machine in a diagram to confirm. what I want is a tighter cone for palm gating and a longer arming to gesture sequence since open pal will transition to none and then to the gesture. so it's not a open palm to pointer for commit it's open pal to none to pointer, we need to have a evolutionary tuning algorithm for the smoothed and prediction pointer cursor, the idea is that it gets better with more data like a ring buffer or something to compare prediction with truth and then adjust to get better tracking, it's evolutionary one euro and physics tuning
---
let's in the sandbox create different demo, the idea is that I can control a cursor using the mediapipeline the ui layer is adapter since what I am building is a gesture control plane. don't code yet, just plan it with me, use sequential thinking and tavily. if my architecture is built correctly I should be able to easily swap between OS. please rate my current set up what am I missing to be hexagonal polymorphic adapter CDD?
---
with the demo I want to see state changes visualized and there should be 
---
One of the main things is that right now we are currently in the I Interlocking interface stage 4 also called Insight and what we need to do is to create red tests Specifically there's a few red tests that I need from you one is I need you to check do we actually have a physics spring dampening system Do we have a physics based predictive cursor system right So what we should have is I think we have right now is three smoothing stages and that actually needs to be changed What we need actually is this a raw media pipeline fingertip which gets translated into a snappy very sort of snappy €1 filter right like we wanted to feel pretty smooth and snappy And then that should drive the physics spring dampening system for a cursor and then once we have a spring driven dampening cursor we should be able to get a predictive physics cursor So what should happen actually is a 4 different cursor view so a quad cursor view of raw €1 filter smooth physics than predictive is that each stage should be swappable and can be built on top of each other but because of our hexagonal contract driven development I should be able to just swap in and out filters as I want If we can't swap filters then there's something wrong
---
arming just palm orientation gate in and out, it can be an arming adapter, we can also make it gesture based as a double check but it should favor the palm orientation. and we can add on directional modifiers so palm towards camera pointing in X direction like a knob. the idea is that right now the gesture based system is brittle. what I want to do is associate it to a physics based object like the palm maybe like a small plane, or a quaternoin of the bones would be even better but I am not sure
---
so the idea is that once the user is considered armed, it should be sticky and ready for gesture, and the only gesture we want right now is pointer up with should trigger the commit, the pointer up gesture = thumb and middle finger pinch, it's the same motion and gesture with different name. so the index finger stays as the pointer and shouldn't move to much, and we have a separate commit gesture that is swappable right now we'll use a hysteresis and stability on pointer up and then lock to palm orientation or open palm as reset. 
---
we need to expose multiple hands and cursors, so our system should be able to handle 2 hands even on mobile phones, i'm aiming for 30fps for tracking which we can use predictive to feel even more responsive. but I think we can do a dynamic adjustment and degradation as well with model hand models and many other tuning parameters, what's important is physics and magnetic snaplock on tracking loss.
---
PHASE DECISION (2025-12-30): Multi-hand is PHASE 1.5 - design interfaces NOW, implement after single cursor works. Key: W3C PointerEvent already supports multi-pointer via pointerId. Our architecture must handle HandFrame[] not just HandFrame. Each hand = separate CursorPipeline instance with unique pointerId. isPrimary=true for dominant hand only. 
---
I actually need you to prioritize creating phases of tests, help me add more red tests to cover inputs and outputs. I want use to be in phase 1 with the goal of a w3c cursor, we can add other features later. the goal is a stateful reliable physics driven cursor
---
ok now do more research and sequential thinking and consider my sandbox specs and research, does this truly give me mosaic hexagonal ports and adapters polymorphic CDD? the idea is that if we use universal standards like w3c then the adapters become trivial since it's already SOP. look at my stack, are we composed of exemplars wrapped in polymorphic adapter contracts? or are we ad hoc? show me where my weakness is
---
check the root hfo daily specs, and help me update it with your research and show me the different phases and use sequential thinking, we are doing TDD what red tests are we missing to validate the architecture? I know that the ui output right now is messy and not standardized, what steps in my pipeline are standardized exemplar like w3c? are there intermediatery contracts that would be helpful and unlock mor epolymorphism?
---
i want you to help me with getting a sample video with annotated or clear training data for mediapipeline and help me feed the video as a golden master and we can see if we get the expected output or I can record a video and manually tell you what I want to do, but ideally there are already annoted small hand video samples, or even just images are fine. the idea is to feed the golden in. and we should get standardized output like cloudevent asyncapi opentelemetry so we can match behavior and use that data to tune the smoothing and predictive layers. the idea is that the system is antifragile and starts learning and adapting to the user based on bahavior and local interactions with no server side telemetry, it's all on device evo tuning. one of the main things is whether each step of the pipeline uses a exemplar contract, for exaple cloudevents or w3c or any other standard. my contracts should not be custom, they should be tested or if custom have clear lineage to high TRL technology and use case.
---
in the interlocking interfact I phase of HIVE/8 also called the insight phase. we need to make sure our system is correctly doing TDD red phase work and we need to check for reward hacking and green but meaningless tests. I think there are some right now and I can't manually check all these tests, so we need gitops pre commit, and hard enforcement for my architectural patterns for HFO. we can not trust ai assistants to correctly build it in the next step without our guidance. use sequential thinking and tavily and confirm if the hfo daily specs w3c is correctly set up and we are following correct TDD BDD CDD with hexagonal polymorphic adaptars using exemplar composition only. there should be minimal custom code, we are a hybrid of the APEX in ANY DOMAIN for MISSION FIT
---
OK so I'm doing a different research tasks and one of the main things I need to do right now is to get a status update of what is the real ground truth status of my system I had a dashboard system set up so that I could easily check the entirety of my status but I'm pretty sure that's now stale So I need your help to essentially update it so that I can get the real progress of my app we are currently in the interlocking interfaces phase of my Hive Base 8 workflow What that means is right now we are in the PDCA do step with a focus on hexagonal contract driven development using exemplar standards for example Cloud events and W3C using things like repair using things like PUTERJS using different exemplars and composing them using a state of the art Standard Operating Procedure standards Contract Driven Development and right now we're in the I phase so we should have lots of red tests and minimal green ones
---
So right now I am currently working on my sandbox specs i've did two different rollups for you to consider and then also a HFO Evolution document inside the sandbox I also want you to take a look at the root Gen 87X3 there is a HFO daily spec so that's sort of what I'm working on and my single source of truth but it's a little bit stale so we need to update it My goal for you is look through it all use sequential thinking and Tavelli web search so that we can get a overarching summary I want you to create a you know ground truth based document an executive summary with a one page bluff and with a diverse mermaid diagram so show me my current progress what I need to do what I need to do next right now I am in PDCA cycle on the DO step I am in the high base 8 interlocking interface I step so that also corresponds to Test Driven Development red phase with a focus on exemplar Standard Operating Procedure Contract Driven Development Please create a one page summary for me to read to understand all this with mermaid diagrams And then let's also have you create another 6 page document as well so a one page document and a 6 page deep dive with timestamps of current time stamp and we're currently in Hive base 8 interlocking interface inside step phase
---
ok, please use sequential thinking atavily and really help me understand, what is our highest priority to unlock my goal of total tool virtualization starting with a reliable and durable gesture finger tip to w3c pointer. our FSM also needs work but we should have POC that we can now build on using the Xstate and strict schema right? I need a matric and where in the pipeline we have custom code and where we adopt exemplar standards, i think the link between each component are too messy, they need hard gat boundaries and my HFo web weaver bridger to connect them using our HOT stigmergy substrate which could just be event bus but really should be NATS core jetstream, KV and object storage
---
wire in nats early. ai has a habit of not following my architecture and recommending lazy options instead. I want my system to be production SOTA pareto optimized. please make sure my hfo daily spec understands we are not going to do the easy thing, we are going to do the right thing and we use sequential thinking and tavily web search to ground us
---
My goal is to and anti fragile strange loop task factory. audit and use sequential thinking and severely web search to confirm what my current progress is how is my design I've been working on this for almost a year and I think the best strange loop that I can find is PDCA So what I want you to do is to create a markdown analyze what's going on and then show me sort of what my next steps are How do I really improve this considering research my problems are not new I'm just composing them in different ways using exemplar pieces and new technology that wasn't available before this is an evolution of exempl not invention
---
I'm currently on VS code using Github copilot and I like being able to use agent and subagents but what I really want is to do an orchestrator pattern with a scatter gather sandbox and hard gated AI agents using my hive base 8 workflow Is that possible in VS code is it possible for me to create an orchestrator that can then coordinate and use subagents because I think this current system doesn't seem to allow me to do it but maybe there's a workaround What are some my best options i'm doing it manually I have you know 4 or 5 different agents on at the same time but you know the cognitive load on me to task switch between the different work i'm trying to keep them in different buckets to mentally and cognitively separate and scaffold the information for myself But I'm starting to hit some hard limits So what I want instead is a facade orchestrator pattern that I can interact with that can then scatter and then gather for me so I don't even touch any of the sub Right now it feels like I'm manually touching each sub
---
let's get my system into puter and I want to see it, in goldenlayout I have some weird scrolling issues and I wonder if it's the platform or if it's my code that is messy, I don't think my stuff are responsive. I think I wrote some red tests for that so please checka nd give me a progress report, how easy is it to put in puter instead of DOM or golden layout? this is a ey test of the polymorphic hexagonal nature of my HFO system, is it actually polymorphic or is the ai just bullshitting me? it should be easy to do. if it's hard i need you to flag the architecture violation. in fact we need to flag any architecture violations now. we are in the validating vanguard step with my roles being the mirror magus for shapers role and pyre praetorian for the immunizer role. the purpose of the validation step is red to green, polymorphic shape changing and pyre defense, it is the elements of water and fire in my HFO trigram mapping
---
we need to create my 8 agents with the spider soverign acting as my orchestrator at the strategic C2 level. please do this first. create 1 markdown of my 8 legendary commanders and what you think their narrative is and what their vs code implementation is. the workflow is HIVE/8 the roles are my OBSIDIAN legendary commanders
---
ok let's do daedalos then. can we make a note that we need stronger enforcement, I had to catch you. you didn't self correct. maybe re require sequential thinking use and inject my architectural principles as a checklist for violations
---
 3-Bit Meaning
Bit 0 (value 1): FORM — Receptive vs Active
Bit 1 (value 2): FLOW — Still vs Moving
Bit 2 (value 4): FORCE — Soft vs Hard
hfo trigrams
---
we need the daedalOS fully. I don't want POC I already got winbox working but it was buggy. I want PRODUCTION READY
---
OK so here's the thing right now we're literally using the Spider Sovereign mode but I'm not sure if it's working correctly Can you do some tests can you call a sub agent can you modify which kind of model or parameter they use Is there MCP servers that we can get so you better understand how to run swarm orchestration?
---
OK you need to check the MCP servers because it is configured for the one agent I am talking to but maybe when we're using subages and stuff things get really funky it it really seems like the swarm orchestration that is currently available is not exactly what I want What I need is hard gated workflows and then swarms of agents in specific roles and persona with you know customizable model families and different things So I don't want to over complicate this right like I have a lot of memory you can search of what my real vision is The the goal right now is we need to do physics checks or what works can you try writing a file can you does it block you can you try going through different stages like you just help me create a checklist of what my hive base 8 workflow should be and then what is currently possible in VS code using these specialized agent modes in vs code and what needs more tools or is just not currently possible yet
---
OK i'm currently testing out the mode and it seems to be working in Park but I'm not sure how well it's actually working here's one of the big questions I need from you answered which is can you do some physics checks Can you actually check what does or does not work and more specifically there's an idea that I have which is for me to use the more expensive model as the orchestrator and then using the swarm scatter gather pattern using cheaper or even free LOL calls like for example using the GBT 5 mini or one of the other ones like it doesn't really matter the idea is what is the cheapest one that I can get to run and swarm and what is the most expensive one I can use to run as the orchestrator should I get the best of both worlds Please make a note of this this is really important and if we can achieve it here in VS code that's OK we can look for other methods but I think you might already have all the tools so please check for me and I need to know the real truth and show me what the limitations are
---
ok I want you to create a spec in the root hfo daily spec called hard gated swarm scatter gather timestamp. we need to get custom mcp servers and we need to start this at H step iteration loop 0 so the first one
---
for a strict workflow, I have some ideas but I need more resaearch with sequential thinking and tavily web search. I was thinking it's persona with specific tools. for example the port 7 spider sovereign has the sequential thinking and port 0 lidless legion might have the web search and stuff, so we break the functions using my HFO galois lattice 8x8. noun x verb pairing for my cards. so in vs code I am not sure how to enforce that with hard gates maybe we log mcp calls and force tool use for the persona? like obsidian spider needs >X sequential thinking calls, etc. it can be tunable. and we enforce the temporal phase with HIVE/8 so if we have a role in a different phase we know right away. we should also have a daemon checking periodically the pyre praetorian my daemon fire paladin essentially
---
we need to go I to V. we are now in V stage. the goal is to get the tests from red to green and create usable demo for example my goldenlayout version seemed to even work but CSS was bad. i wanted to do daelusOS adapter to test there, and I need multiple windows open. does that make sense, I am creating for windows and integration in with w3c pointer envelope. or are we not ready yet? we can stay with goldenlayout just clean it up slightly with a screenshot you'll see all the clipping
---
I'm going to attach an image This is much better it does look better but you can see that there's still a lot of clipping right it seems like the layouts are not responsive and I think that's really the one of the core issues but otherwise this is getting much much closer to what I want I think we're just gonna stick with golden layout for a little bit in the future we'll we'll switch to like a full OS or in fact we can probably put data list OS inside a golden layout too so should be pretty flexible that's the reason we make built it this way it's polymorphic hexagonal adapters Please tell me if it's not because it should be
---
So right now something interesting about the gesture finite state machine especially from media pipelines is that it is using the gesture transition to none transition to the other gesture so if we gate it enough this transition we can actually map the user behavior over time and even use a predictive filter like a physics filter right like which we should already have with rapier so that we can get this transitional prediction and usefulness The ideas like our state machine needs to be state enough so that it it allows that brief period of transition to maybe even the the wrong like none and then going into point your up for that commit gesture and that clicking right I know for fact right now that our palm cone army sequence is way too loose it needs to be a lot harder the user needs to point their palm towards the camera to be armed and then essentially when their palm cone leaves facing away from the camera essentially then it disarms it right and just I think it's like pointer cancel or something like that but I even sure again the the cursor should always follow the index finger right the index finger it never changes right so even if I bend my index finger whatever it doesn't matter just always my index finger tip is the pointer the palm cone is for the army sequence for the commit gesture
---
the commit gesture we can just use the pointer up from mediapipeline gesture It's just that internally we also need to note that pointer up is equivalent to middle ring and pinky pinch with thumb does that make sense like essentially the to get into the pointing motion the middle finger and the thumb will have to get really close like that's just how ergonomics work
---

---
I am currently working on my HFO daily spec the W3C implementation especially using the Golden layout version so can you tell me what my current progress is and use a dashboard and get verified information and don't forget to use sequential thinking and to tavily to ground your thoughts is you know in my following best practices am I really missing something am I going in the right direction my goal right now is to turn from a noisy pipeline of media
---
install pre commit hooks and run git ops. i'm glad the demo is working but I am certain alot of it is reward hacking and the infrastructure on the backend is likely theater for example check if nats is the event bus or ai reward hacked. I need to find out what is following my specs and what are hacky ad hoc ai slop that ai has coded specifically to pass my tests but bypass my architecture
---
ok, help me analyze, this should be alot of data. what do you notice are important for me? how do we mine this as my personal notes and specific analysis. can you inferr things about me like personality tests? I want data that I can use to improve my dev workflow. i keep fighting ai and I think it's due to the training data. it's designed to please me not to do the right thing and that is annoying when I am engineering
---
you need to check the daily spec for the swarm. we need to create the memory graph and enforce it's usage along with sequential thinking and tavily grounding
---
I need you to search my repo and start pulling out my legendary commanders and their information I think I've already done some research I already have some of it but I need my eight legendary commanders that are their legendary quine intersection of noun versus what I really need is my Obsidian grimoire and what it is it's my narrative interpretation with polymorphic adapters for declarative Gherkin Mernae diagrams and system based engineering essentially I'm using a narrative structure to define literate programming and declarative Gherkin with associated mermaid diagrams in UML format for models based system engineering I think some of the best words for what the grimoire really is is a galois lattice a mapping of different dimensions of a HFO because there's so many different dimensions like the trigram elements binary octre spatial subdivisions JDC 2 verbs MAS roles Greek metaphysical ontology and they fit specific purposes and ports and numbers the numbers 0 through seven are very specific because it helps divide 3D space into a coordinate system
---
I'm doing a personal analysis on myself and I want you to look through my other folders like my contacts payloads and my work overtime and really help enrich this personal analysis for how can I be a better programmer encoder What workflow am I doing correctly i'm trying to transition to a high base 8 workflow which is essentially my own thematic wrapper for PDCA the reason I'm wrapping it is because I want to use swarm orchestration so I'm extending a lot of these concepts but it's not like I'm building off of you know random stuff i'm using literally only exemplar compositions and the idea is that I'm using this and then I'm extending out the capabilities a little more so I can use it better for my cognitive Symbiote swarm orchestration mission engineering platform right like it's a polymorphic hexagonal portion adapters substrate that's hard gated and forced with you know standard operating procedure contracts and polymorphism I think I'm actually able to do it right like you can see sort of my architecture and some of my demos like I know I can do this in parts already now I want to do it all together so I really need some analysis on how I can better do that right So please look through my notes query the memory system you know use as much as you need and minimize my user input and really help enrich and actually create like a version 2 like personal analysis in my notes right like help me understand myself better and where my strength and weaknesses are I especially care about my limitations I know I am weak especially on the area of discipline and test driven development but I'm trying to make discipline a non factor with gitops so that I have no choice and the AI has no escape hatch
---
please update the hfo daily spec with our work here on the swarm. and let's ingest with evolutionary timeline. I worked On specific generations at specific times in a linear fashion so for example if at a certain date I was working on generation 50 and then the later in a few more days it says that I was working on generation 43 for example then fundamentally there's something wrong maybe there's a timestamp that was faked or wrong or maybe the generation numbers are wrong but it is a been a completely iterative sequential process for this whole year and that's sort of what I'm trying to escape as well I want to use swarm orchestration so I stopped being so sequential but I'm already starting that actually I actually have like 3 or 4 AI running in the background all the time But you know I'm still the main orchestrator and that is my main problem I need to become the intent level warlock not the AI level swarm orchestrator
---
ok let's start a new n+1 HIVE/8 Let's start now with D H Hunter and what I want you to do is use my memory MCP to sort of remember where we are and then let's ground ourselves in a one is currently working on there should be two different daily HFO daily specs So let's ground ourselves in that right like we should be working off of the specs we shouldn't be deviating from the specs we can always add to the specs and change the specs but we should be doing it in stage as progressively The first thing in terms right now is let's use sequential thinking let's use the memory source let's use you know web search so right right now we really should be using the littlest Legion but I'm not sure if they're fully set up yet They should be my full censor suite and censor mesh right And Navigator right now is essentially the spider solvent and they should have access to my doc DB memory for FTS file search my memory graph and access to things like sequential thinking and tools like that so right now this we need to formalize it probably as like some kind of maybe we can use like one MCP tool for each role and that will be like the unified that will then breakdown into separate little ones I was thinking of some kind of format like Claude skills
---
OK check my memory system MCP server and I want you to essentially take a look at my current implementation with my W3C pointer gesture control plane I believe I have too many different MCP stuff so please take a look there and then I know inside my repo is getting pretty messy I'm not sure which one is the correct one I think we need to start refactoring so I want your help in cleaning up umm and doing like a smart cleanup non destructively so archive stuff don't delete and my goal is to get the working demo I think I tested one of them I think it was like the demo real architecture and it seems to be working but I'm pretty sure the finite state machine is a giant mess it's not correct and I'm pretty sure I'm not even getting the media pipeline visualization i'm not getting the pass through on the gesture states like I should be having a much better golden layout I should be having like a different tab for changing some of the settings for media pipeline and the gesture recognition like it it really seems like my current implementation is very bare bones compared to the actual implementation in my specs so please help me understand the gap and help me start implementing and creating the actual application please
---
thank you for this production ready check. we need to enforce it as part of the HFO dev dashboard document in root that we will create as a dev dashboard that we can run scripts to auto update and show me progress and tests status and other dev dashboard uses. in fact we can use golden layout and create a html to checl
---
this is very useful, please save to memory MCP that we should be really improving the dev dashboard and even adding more visuals a cognitive frameworks and learning scaffolding for me so that it's easy for me at a glance to activate System 1 and system 2 thinking
