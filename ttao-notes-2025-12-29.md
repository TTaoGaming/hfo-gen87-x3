the daedalos with emulators would be perfect for what I want to do. I want to do excalidraw but it can then w3c pointer into emulators directly. give me some more search and ideas. you can see my vision for total tool virtualization, what would be the steps to do this, this is my primitive i am building for so much more than this

I think you are losing context create The Obsidian blackboard following my actual HFO format and then just append the note and get ready for hand off right now we're in the first hand phase Now we're just looking for information and finding exemplars and I'm seeing so many new options that I didn't know it was impossible so this is great the original tech stack that I was thinking was closer toward like media to repair physics to finite state machine to W3C pointer to whatever I want

ok now use the tools. check my pipeline trade study and do another check. how can we set up hexagonal CDD? I want to set up the components and then let ai swarm combine and evolve and use the primitives does that make sense? we need to research this. the hive/8 workflow was never designed to be sequential that's only bootstrap it should be powers of 8 :1010 at minimum

daelos and other window apps like emulator js could solve classes of problems

check my pipeline trade study and use sequential thinking and tavily and other tools to create a new v2 with more info especially with my goal of hexagonal CDD exemplar composable pieces, I can create many different for map elite. I don't need to be vendor locked
