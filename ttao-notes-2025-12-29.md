the daedalos with emulators would be perfect for what I want to do. I want to do excalidraw but it can then w3c pointer into emulators directly. give me some more search and ideas. you can see my vision for total tool virtualization, what would be the steps to do this, this is my primitive i am building for so much more than this
---
I think you are losing context create The Obsidian blackboard following my actual HFO format and then just append the note and get ready for hand off right now we're in the first hand phase Now we're just looking for information and finding exemplars and I'm seeing so many new options that I didn't know it was impossible so this is great the original tech stack that I was thinking was closer toward like media to repair physics to finite state machine to W3C pointer to whatever I want 
---
ok now use the tools. check my pipeline trade study and do another check. how can we set up hexagonal CDD? I want to set up the components and then let ai swarm combine and evolve and use the primitives does that make sense? we need to research this. the hive/8 workflow was never designed to be sequential that's only bootstrap it should be powers of 8 :1010 at minimum
---
daelos and other window apps like emulator js could solve classes of problems
---
check my pipeline trade study and use sequential thinking and tavily and other tools to create a new v2 with more info especially with my goal of hexagonal CDD exemplar composable pieces, I can create many different for map elite. I don't need to be vendor locked
---
need to note a few things. we need to visualize the state machine in a diagram to confirm. what I want is a tighter cone for palm gating and a longer arming to gesture sequence since open pal will transition to none and then to the gesture. so it's not a open palm to pointer for commit it's open pal to none to pointer, we need to have a evolutionary tuning algorithm for the smoothed and prediction pointer cursor, the idea is that it gets better with more data like a ring buffer or something to compare prediction with truth and then adjust to get better tracking, it's evolutionary one euro and physics tuning
---
let's in the sandbox create different demo, the idea is that I can control a cursor using the mediapipeline the ui layer is adapter since what I am building is a gesture control plane. don't code yet, just plan it with me, use sequential thinking and tavily. if my architecture is built correctly I should be able to easily swap between OS. please rate my current set up what am I missing to be hexagonal polymorphic adapter CDD?
---
with the demo I want to see state changes visualized and there should be

One of the main things is that right now we are currently in the I Interlocking interface stage 4 also called Insight and what we need to do is to create red tests Specifically there's a few red tests that I need from you one is I need you to check do we actually have a physics spring dampening system Do we have a physics based predictive cursor system right So what we should have is I think we have right now is three smoothing stages and that actually needs to be changed What we need actually is this a raw media pipeline fingertip which gets translated into a snappy very sort of snappy €1 filter right like we wanted to feel pretty smooth and snappy And then that should drive the physics spring dampening system for a cursor and then once we have a spring driven dampening cursor we should be able to get a predictive physics cursor So what should happen actually is a 4 different cursor view so a quad cursor view of raw €1 filter smooth physics than predictive is that each stage should be swappable and can be built on top of each other but because of our hexagonal contract driven development I should be able to just swap in and out filters as I want If we can't swap filters then there's something wrong
---
arming just palm orientation gate in and out, it can be an arming adapter, we can also make it gesture based as a double check but it should favor the palm orientation. and we can add on directional modifiers so palm towards camera pointing in X direction like a knob. the idea is that right now the gesture based system is brittle. what I want to do is associate it to a physics based object like the palm maybe like a small plane, or a quaternoin of the bones would be even better but I am not sure
---
so the idea is that once the user is considered armed, it should be sticky and ready for gesture, and the only gesture we want right now is pointer up with should trigger the commit, the pointer up gesture = thumb and middle finger pinch, it's the same motion and gesture with different name. so the index finger stays as the pointer and shouldn't move to much, and we have a separate commit gesture that is swappable right now we'll use a hysteresis and stability on pointer up and then lock to palm orientation or open palm as reset. 
---
we need to expose multiple hands and cursors, so our system should be able to handle 2 hands even on mobile phones, i'm aiming for 30fps for tracking which we can use predictive to feel even more responsive. but I think we can do a dynamic adjustment and degradation as well with model hand models and many other tuning parameters, what's important is physics and magnetic snaplock on tracking loss.
---
PHASE DECISION (2025-12-30): Multi-hand is PHASE 1.5 - design interfaces NOW, implement after single cursor works. Key: W3C PointerEvent already supports multi-pointer via pointerId. Our architecture must handle HandFrame[] not just HandFrame. Each hand = separate CursorPipeline instance with unique pointerId. isPrimary=true for dominant hand only. 
---
I actually need you to prioritize creating phases of tests, help me add more red tests to cover inputs and outputs. I want use to be in phase 1 with the goal of a w3c cursor, we can add other features later. the goal is a stateful reliable physics driven cursor
---
ok now do more research and sequential thinking and consider my sandbox specs and research, does this truly give me mosaic hexagonal ports and adapters polymorphic CDD? the idea is that if we use universal standards like w3c then the adapters become trivial since it's already SOP. look at my stack, are we composed of exemplars wrapped in polymorphic adapter contracts? or are we ad hoc? show me where my weakness is
---
check the root hfo daily specs, and help me update it with your research and show me the different phases and use sequential thinking, we are doing TDD what red tests are we missing to validate the architecture? I know that the ui output right now is messy and not standardized, what steps in my pipeline are standardized exemplar like w3c? are there intermediatery contracts that would be helpful and unlock mor epolymorphism?
---
i want you to help me with getting a sample video with annotated or clear training data for mediapipeline and help me feed the video as a golden master and we can see if we get the expected output or I can record a video and manually tell you what I want to do, but ideally there are already annoted small hand video samples, or even just images are fine. the idea is to feed the golden in. and we should get standardized output like cloudevent asyncapi opentelemetry so we can match behavior and use that data to tune the smoothing and predictive layers. the idea is that the system is antifragile and starts learning and adapting to the user based on bahavior and local interactions with no server side telemetry, it's all on device evo tuning. one of the main things is whether each step of the pipeline uses a exemplar contract, for exaple cloudevents or w3c or any other standard. my contracts should not be custom, they should be tested or if custom have clear lineage to high TRL technology and use case.
---
in the interlocking interfact I phase of HIVE/8 also called the insight phase. we need to make sure our system is correctly doing TDD red phase work and we need to check for reward hacking and green but meaningless tests. I think there are some right now and I can't manually check all these tests, so we need gitops pre commit, and hard enforcement for my architectural patterns for HFO. we can not trust ai assistants to correctly build it in the next step without our guidance. use sequential thinking and tavily and confirm if the hfo daily specs w3c is correctly set up and we are following correct TDD BDD CDD with hexagonal polymorphic adaptars using exemplar composition only. there should be minimal custom code, we are a hybrid of the APEX in ANY DOMAIN for MISSION FIT
---
OK so I'm doing a different research tasks and one of the main things I need to do right now is to get a status update of what is the real ground truth status of my system I had a dashboard system set up so that I could easily check the entirety of my status but I'm pretty sure that's now stale So I need your help to essentially update it so that I can get the real progress of my app we are currently in the interlocking interfaces phase of my Hive Base 8 workflow What that means is right now we are in the PDCA do step with a focus on hexagonal contract driven development using exemplar standards for example Cloud events and W3C using things like repair using things like PUTERJS using different exemplars and composing them using a state of the art Standard Operating Procedure standards Contract Driven Development and right now we're in the I phase so we should have lots of red tests and minimal green ones
---
So right now I am currently working on my sandbox specs i've did two different rollups for you to consider and then also a HFO Evolution document inside the sandbox I also want you to take a look at the root Gen 87X3 there is a HFO daily spec so that's sort of what I'm working on and my single source of truth but it's a little bit stale so we need to update it My goal for you is look through it all use sequential thinking and Tavelli web search so that we can get a overarching summary I want you to create a you know ground truth based document an executive summary with a one page bluff and with a diverse mermaid diagram so show me my current progress what I need to do what I need to do next right now I am in PDCA cycle on the DO step I am in the high base 8 interlocking interface I step so that also corresponds to Test Driven Development red phase with a focus on exemplar Standard Operating Procedure Contract Driven Development Please create a one page summary for me to read to understand all this with mermaid diagrams And then let's also have you create another 6 page document as well so a one page document and a 6 page deep dive with timestamps of current time stamp and we're currently in Hive base 8 interlocking interface inside step phase
---
ok, please use sequential thinking atavily and really help me understand, what is our highest priority to unlock my goal of total tool virtualization starting with a reliable and durable gesture finger tip to w3c pointer. our FSM also needs work but we should have POC that we can now build on using the Xstate and strict schema right? I need a matric and where in the pipeline we have custom code and where we adopt exemplar standards, i think the link between each component are too messy, they need hard gat boundaries and my HFo web weaver bridger to connect them using our HOT stigmergy substrate which could just be event bus but really should be NATS core jetstream, KV and object storage
---
wire in nats early. ai has a habit of not following my architecture and recommending lazy options instead. I want my system to be production SOTA pareto optimized. please make sure my hfo daily spec understands we are not going to do the easy thing, we are going to do the right thing and we use sequential thinking and tavily web search to ground us
---
My goal is to and anti fragile strange loop task factory. audit and use sequential thinking and severely web search to confirm what my current progress is how is my design I've been working on this for almost a year and I think the best strange loop that I can find is PDCA So what I want you to do is to create a markdown analyze what's going on and then show me sort of what my next steps are How do I really improve this considering research my problems are not new I'm just composing them in different ways using exemplar pieces and new technology that wasn't available before this is an evolution of exempl not invention
---
I'm currently on VS code using Github copilot and I like being able to use agent and subagents but what I really want is to do an orchestrator pattern with a scatter gather sandbox and hard gated AI agents using my hive base 8 workflow Is that possible in VS code is it possible for me to create an orchestrator that can then coordinate and use subagents because I think this current system doesn't seem to allow me to do it but maybe there's a workaround What are some my best options i'm doing it manually I have you know 4 or 5 different agents on at the same time but you know the cognitive load on me to task switch between the different work i'm trying to keep them in different buckets to mentally and cognitively separate and scaffold the information for myself But I'm starting to hit some hard limits So what I want instead is a facade orchestrator pattern that I can interact with that can then scatter and then gather for me so I don't even touch any of the sub Right now it feels like I'm manually touching each sub
