the daedalos with emulators would be perfect for what I want to do. I want to do excalidraw but it can then w3c pointer into emulators directly. give me some more search and ideas. you can see my vision for total tool virtualization, what would be the steps to do this, this is my primitive i am building for so much more than this

I think you are losing context create The Obsidian blackboard following my actual HFO format and then just append the note and get ready for hand off right now we're in the first hand phase Now we're just looking for information and finding exemplars and I'm seeing so many new options that I didn't know it was impossible so this is great the original tech stack that I was thinking was closer toward like media to repair physics to finite state machine to W3C pointer to whatever I want

ok now use the tools. check my pipeline trade study and do another check. how can we set up hexagonal CDD? I want to set up the components and then let ai swarm combine and evolve and use the primitives does that make sense? we need to research this. the hive/8 workflow was never designed to be sequential that's only bootstrap it should be powers of 8 :1010 at minimum

daelos and other window apps like emulator js could solve classes of problems
---
check my pipeline trade study and use sequential thinking and tavily and other tools to create a new v2 with more info especially with my goal of hexagonal CDD exemplar composable pieces, I can create many different for map elite. I don't need to be vendor locked
---
need to note a few things. we need to visualize the state machine in a diagram to confirm. what I want is a tighter cone for palm gating and a longer arming to gesture sequence since open pal will transition to none and then to the gesture. so it's not a open palm to pointer for commit it's open pal to none to pointer, we need to have a evolutionary tuning algorithm for the smoothed and prediction pointer cursor, the idea is that it gets better with more data like a ring buffer or something to compare prediction with truth and then adjust to get better tracking, it's evolutionary one euro and physics tuning
---
let's in the sandbox create different demo, the idea is that I can control a cursor using the mediapipeline the ui layer is adapter since what I am building is a gesture control plane. don't code yet, just plan it with me, use sequential thinking and tavily. if my architecture is built correctly I should be able to easily swap between OS. please rate my current set up what am I missing to be hexagonal polymorphic adapter CDD?

with the demo I want to see state changes visualized and there should be

One of the main things is that right now we are currently in the I Interlocking interface stage 4 also called Insight and what we need to do is to create red tests Specifically there's a few red tests that I need from you one is I need you to check do we actually have a physics spring dampening system Do we have a physics based predictive cursor system right So what we should have is I think we have right now is three smoothing stages and that actually needs to be changed What we need actually is this a raw media pipeline fingertip which gets translated into a snappy very sort of snappy €1 filter right like we wanted to feel pretty smooth and snappy And then that should drive the physics spring dampening system for a cursor and then once we have a spring driven dampening cursor we should be able to get a predictive physics cursor So what should happen actually is a 4 different cursor view so a quad cursor view of raw €1 filter smooth physics than predictive is that each stage should be swappable and can be built on top of each other but because of our hexagonal contract driven development I should be able to just swap in and out filters as I want If we can't swap filters then there's something wrong

arming just palm orientation gate in and out, it can be an arming adapter, we can also make it gesture based as a double check but it should favor the palm orientation. and we can add on directional modifiers so palm towards camera pointing in X direction like a knob. the idea is that right now the gesture based system is brittle. what I want to do is associate it to a physics based object like the palm maybe like a small plane, or a quaternoin of the bones would be even better but I am not sure
---
so the idea is that once the user is considered armed, it should be sticky and ready for gesture, and the only gesture we want right now is pointer up with should trigger the commit, the pointer up gesture = thumb and middle finger pinch, it's the same motion and gesture with different name. so the index finger stays as the pointer and shouldn't move to much, and we have a separate commit gesture that is swappable right now we'll use a hysteresis and stability on pointer up and then lock to palm orientation or open palm as reset. 
---
we need to expose multiple hands and cursors, so our system should be able to handle 2 hands even on mobile phones, i'm aiming for 30fps for tracking which we can use predictive to feel even more responsive. but I think we can do a dynamic adjustment and degradation as well with model hand models and many other tuning parameters, what's important is physics and magnetic snaplock on tracking loss.
---
PHASE DECISION (2025-12-30): Multi-hand is PHASE 1.5 - design interfaces NOW, implement after single cursor works. Key: W3C PointerEvent already supports multi-pointer via pointerId. Our architecture must handle HandFrame[] not just HandFrame. Each hand = separate CursorPipeline instance with unique pointerId. isPrimary=true for dominant hand only. 
---
I actually need you to prioritize creating phases of tests, help me add more red tests to cover inputs and outputs. I want use to be in phase 1 with the goal of a w3c cursor, we can add other features later. the goal is a stateful reliable physics driven cursor
