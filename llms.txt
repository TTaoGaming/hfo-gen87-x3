# HFO Gen87.X3 — Pre-Configured AI Workspace

> Generation: 87.X3
> Date: 2025-12-29
> Status: AUTO-APPROVE ENABLED - All tools ready

## What Is This?

Pre-configured workspace for HFO development with:
- All MCP tools auto-approved (GitHub, Memory, Playwright, Context7)
- Memory bank mounted (6,423 artifacts)
- Gen85 codebase reference (687 tests)
- Context payloads available

## Tools Ready

✅ GitHub MCP - Repo/issue/PR management
✅ Memory MCP - Knowledge graph persistence
✅ Playwright MCP - Browser automation
✅ Context7 MCP - Library docs
✅ Sequential Thinking - Chain-of-thought
✅ Filesystem MCP - Direct file access

## Key Files

1. ../GEN87_X1_GOLD_BATON_QUINE.md - Full architecture (READ THIS)
2. ../FORENSIC_ANALYSIS_AI_FAILURES_2025.md - Failure modes
3. sandbox/ - YOUR WRITE ZONE

## Architecture

HIVE/8 = H(Hunt) → I(Interlock) → V(Validate) → E(Evolve)
       = Research → RED → GREEN → REFACTOR

8 Ports: 0=SENSE, 1=FUSE, 2=SHAPE, 3=DELIVER, 4=TEST, 5=DEFEND, 6=STORE, 7=DECIDE

## Memory Query

```python
import duckdb
con = duckdb.connect('../portable_hfo_memory_pre_hfo_to_gen84_2025-12-27T21-46-52/hfo_memory.duckdb', read_only=True)
con.execute('LOAD fts')
results = con.execute("SELECT filename, generation, fts_main_artifacts.match_bm25(id, 'your query') as score FROM artifacts WHERE score IS NOT NULL ORDER BY score DESC LIMIT 10").fetchall()
```

## Rules

1. NEVER hallucinate - cite sources
2. ALWAYS work in sandbox/
3. NEVER delete without permission
4. VERIFY with tools, not assumptions

## The Mantra

> "The spider weaves the web that weaves the spider."
