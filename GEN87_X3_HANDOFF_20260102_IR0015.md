# GEN87_X3_HANDOFF_20260102_IR0015.md

## 🚨 Incident: IR-0015 (Stream Terminated / Freeze)
- **Timestamp**: 2026-01-02
- **Context**: The agent was in the middle of diagnosing 11 E2E failures in `playwright-unified.config.ts`.
- **User Report**: "i think there was a freeze please be more careful" and "incident stream terminated error".

## 📊 Current State
- **Vitest**: 100% Pass (1242/1242).
- **E2E**: 11/102 failures.
  - **Port 5173**: `demo-freeze-diagnosis.spec.ts` still hitting 5173 (needs 8081).
  - **Theater**: `showcase-launcher.ts` confirmed as "Theater" (missing `DOMAdapter.inject()` in some paths).
  - **GoldenLayout**: `ux-standards.spec.ts` failing to find `.lm_item`.
- **Report**: `hot/silver/CURRENT_STATE_REPORT.md` is up to date.

## 🎯 Next Actions for Incoming Agent
1. **Fix Port Mismatches**: Search and replace all `localhost:5173` with `localhost:8081` in `e2e/` directory.
2. **Resolve Pipeline Theater**: Audit `showcase-launcher.ts` and ensure `domAdapter.inject(event)` is called for all pointer events.
3. **Debug GoldenLayout Rendering**: Investigate why `.lm_item` is missing in BDD tests.
4. **Verify Fixes**: Run `npx playwright test --config=playwright-unified.config.ts`.

## 📡 Stigmergy
- **Blackboard**: IR-0015 logged.
- **HIVE Phase**: `H` (Hunt) / `I` (Interlock).
